= Spring Cloud Contract samples

The goal of this repository is to show by use cases how we can use https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/[Spring Cloud Contract] to validate the compatibility between
an API provider and one or more consumer by using `Consumer Driven Contract` testing. 

CDC testing is a technique to test whether an API provider and one or many API consumer(s) are compliant with a predefined contract 
without having to deploy a complete system in order to reduce the end-to-end integration testing that comes with its complexity.

The problem with end-to-end tests is that they often fail for no apparent reason and are very slow. 
There is nothing more frustrating than seeing that, after running for ten hours, the end-to-end tests have failed due to a typo in the API call.
So the goal is to minimize the end-to-end tests to the absolutely necessary and perform as much tests as we can in lower level according to the link:https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html[test pyramid]

Spring Cloud Contract is a framework that can help you to validate contracts without having to run end-to-end test so you have faster feedback.
This is achieved by using Spring Cloud Contract Verifier with Stub Runner.

The main purposes of Spring Cloud Contract Verifier with Stub Runner are:

- To ensure that WireMock/Messaging stubs (used when developing the client) do exactly what the actual server-side implementation does.
- To promote Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) method and Microservices architectural style.
- To provide a way to publish changes in contracts that are immediately visible on both sides.
- To generate boilerplate test code to be used on the server side.

It supports both HTTP and message-based interactions.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Spring Cloud Contract Verifier’s purpose is NOT to start writing business features in the contracts.
Assume that we have a business use case of fraud check.
If a user can be a fraud for 100 different reasons, we would assume that you would create 2 contracts, one for the positive case and one for the negative case.
Contract tests are used to test contracts between applications and not to simulate full behavior.

[NOTE]
====
One of the "problems" with Spring Cloud Contract was that the DSL had to be written in Groovy.
Even though the contract didn’t require any special knowledge of the language, it became a problem for non-JVM users.

On the producer side, Spring Cloud Contract generates tests in Java or Groovy.
Of course, it became a problem to use those tests in a non-JVM environment.

Not only do you need to have Java installed, but the tests are generated with a Maven or Gradle plugin, which requires using those build tools.

=== Projects

It has benn voluntary reduced to 2 projects.

==== Producer

The producer application contains contracts for both REST and messaging
communication. From these contracts tests and stubs will be generated.

The producer in the contract also uses features like usage of common libraries, different
combination of dynamic properties.

It also uses scenario based contracts. That means that the produced stubs are stateful.

==== Consumer

The consumer application is using the stubs of the producer for both rest and messaging.

It also contains the consumer side of the stateful scenario case. By calling the same endpoint a couple
 of times we get different responses due to changing state.

== How to build it?

The order should be as follows

- producer (from where we publish the contracts)
- consumer

If the order is different then your apps will blow up most likely due to missing stubs.

So with gradle, you can run:

```sh
# clean, build and test the producer and publish its contracts
./gradlew clean build publishToMavenLocal -p beer-api-producer
# clean, build and test the consumer with the contracts
./gradlew clean build -p beer-api-consumer
```

Or in maven:

```sh
# clean, build and test the producer and publish its contracts
./mvnw clean install -pl beer-api-producer
# clean, build and test the consumer with the contracts
./mvnw clean test -pl beer-api-consumer
```

== Spring Cloud Contract developer workflow

Initially link:https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/[Spring Cloud Contract] had to be written in groovy but since the latest release,
you can also write them in `yaml`, `json` and it also supports link:https://docs.pact.io/[Pact] specification format.

`Spring Cloud Contract` promotes a centralized approach to define contracts where the consumer can define contracts in the provider git repository 
or if the consumer is not allowed to do so, in an external git repository dedicated for the contracts of this provider.

The first approach is the simplest as your contracts are versioned with your implementation so you don't need to maintain a mapping table between 
your contracts version and the implementation version.
That's why we choose to define contract in the provider in producer project.

For the simplicity of the demo, `beer-api-producer` and `beer-api-consumer` resides in the same git repository but ideally, 
each of them should reside in its own repository and that's what we will consider in the following steps.

=== Consumer side

1. Develop your feature in `beer-api-consumer` in TDD.
    1. Start doing TDD by writing a test for your feature.
    1. Write the missing implementation.
1. Define the contract proposal in `beer-api-producer`.
    1. Clone the `beer-api-producer` service repository locally.
    1. Define the contract locally in the repo of `beer-api-producer` service.
    1. Add the `Spring Cloud Contract Verifier` plugin (gradle or maven plugin).
1. Test `beer-api-consumer` against the previously generated contracts.
    1. Configure `Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner` (test dependency) to retrieve the contracts from maven local repository.
    1. Run the integration tests with the Stub Runner.
1. File a pull request `beer-api-producer` once the tests passed.

=== Producer side

[start=5]
. Create an initial implementation.
. Take over the pull request.
. Write the missing implementation.
. Deploy your app.

=== Back to consumer side

[start=9]
. Merge your feature branch into master.
. Work online: consume contracts from remote repository instead of local.

== Spring Cloud Contract in CI/CD

In a microservice world, each application should be autonomous and so independently deployable.

So during every build, we must check if the application is consistent with its current contracts and the contracts that are currently running on production.
This means that we cannot do any breaking changes.

Actually, any breaking change can be implemented as a set (in the context of the API, a set always means two) of non-breaking changes.
For example, if you want to change the type of the field from Date to DateTime you use the following pattern:

. Expose the `DateTime` field in the API. On production you now return both fields, however, the contract now guarantees only the new one.
. Wait until all client applications migrate to the new field. It’s pretty fast, as all tests will show only the `DateTime` field (contract protection) and without switching to the new field, you won’t be able to compile the application (CDC test fails).
. Remove the `Date` field.

=== API provider side

To be more confident when we will deliver a new version of the provider in production we need to ensure at build time that the latest API
remains compatible with the one already deployed in production.

So in CDC, it means that all the latest CDC tests and the old CDC tests from the version deployed in production should pass at build time.

[cols="^,^,^", options="header"]
.API provider - CDC tests
|===
|                     | Latest    | Production
| *Contract verifier* | Build     | Build
|===

Technically, it means we will verify the contracts by sending requests as the latest API consumers and the production API consumer will do.

As we are in the provider and as its git repository contains all the latest contracts from all its consumer, testing the latest CDC tests is performed by
running `./mvnw test -pl beer-api-producer` or `./gradlew check -p beer-api-producer` whether you are using maven or gradle.

To test against the API compatibility version in production, you can run:

- In maven

```sh
./mvnw test -PapiCompatibility -pl beer-api-producer -Dlatest.producertion.version=<your_version>
```

- In gradle

```sh
./gradlew apiCompatibility -p beer-api-producer -DlatestProducertionVersion=<your_version>
```

==== Playground

If you didn't modify the code, `beer-api-consumer` and `beer-api-producer` should be in version `0.0.1-SNAPSHOT`.

In this scenario, we will consider `beer-api-producer:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT` to be deployed in production environment and
we will try to make the API compatibility test fail by introducing a breaking change.
We will also use the local maven repository for the sake of simplicity.

. Publish the contract of `beer-api-producer:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT`

    ./mvnw clean install -pl beer-api-producer
    # Or
    ./gradlew clean build publishToMavenLocal -p beer-api-producer

. Increment the version of `beer-api-producer` to `0.0.2-SNAPSHOT` and make a breaking change
You can checkout the branch `git checkout producer-breaking-change-1` as an example.
Then try to run:

    ./mvnw clean test -pl beer-api-producer
    # Or
    ./gradlew clean check -p beer-api-producer
+
Some tests should fail.

. Adapt the contracts to make tests passed again.
You can checkout the branch `git checkout producer-breaking-change-2` as an example.
Rerun the previous step and now the tests should pass.
. Then, run the API compatibility check against `beer-api-producer:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT`

    ./mvnw test -PapiCompatibility -pl beer-api-producer -Dlatest.production.version.version=0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
    # Or
    ./gradlew apiCompatibility -p beer-api-producer -DlatestProductionVersion=0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
+
And now some tests fail again because the new producer API is not backward compatible with `0.0.1-SNAPSHOT`.

You probably noticed the tests failure cause is `NullPointerException`.
It is because when the consumer does not send the `yearsOld` value, this value is null on the server side and it is currently not handled correctly.
Ideally, if this value is required, you should have another contract stating that if this value is not sent by the consumer,
then the provider should reply with an error 400 like and handle null value accordingly.

=== API consumer side

On the consumer side, we need to perform similar tests but instead of mocking the consumer request, we will verify the contracts against stubs
from the latest as describe in the following table:

The tests are by default already configured to retrieve the latest stubs, so you can run these tests with
`./mvnw test -pl beer-api-consumer` or `./gradlew check -p beer-api-consumer` whether you are using maven or gradle.

Theoretically, if you follow the development workflow, you only merge your feature branch on the consumer side when the feature is implemented on the provider side.
Assuming you will deliver your API provider in production soon (in minutes) after it has been released, you should not have this issue.

Well, it's not always working like that especially if you have more than one testing environment (performance, user acceptance, etc.).
In this context, the latest provider might be rejected in one environment and so it takes more time to go to production.
And now the question is how to ensure API compatibility between the latest released consumer and the already deployed provider ?

Testing the API consumer against the latest production stubs will let you known if you can deploy your client to production
(this can be transposed to other environment) or not.
It is especially important when you deal with breaking change in 2 non breaking changes (see above) because if these tests fail,
it means the stub runner didn't find any matching contract and so by transitivity it means the API producer deployed in production
does not implement the latest API you are using.

[cols="^,^,^", options="header"]
.API consumer - CDC tests
|===
|             | Latest    | Production
| *Stubs*     | Build     | Before Deployment
|===

Unfortunately, the latter is not as straightforward to setup as in the producer side.
An issue has been raised for this https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/issues/686.

== Conclusion

link:https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/[Spring Cloud Contract] is - even if it is already in version 2.0.0.RELEASE - still young and under active development compare to
link:https://docs.pact.io[Pact] but it has the merit to propose a different workflow where more collaboration is required between the consumer and the producer.

I hope this how-to can better help you to understand what is CDC testing, its purpose and how it is implemented in link:https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/[Spring Cloud Contract].

Of course in real life, applications are most of the time API producer and API consumer, so the configuration might be slightly different in this
situation but the principle remains the same.
